## How to Install

When you create a new project using [Pokémon Studio](https://github.com/PokemonWorkshop/PokemonStudio/releases), PSDK is automatically installed on your PC in the following folder:
`appdata\local\programs\pokemon-studio\resources\psdk-binaries\pokemonsdk`.

The application offers a dedicated page to keep it up to date.

### Use your own PSDK codebase

> ⚠️ Recommended for advanced users only.

If you prefer to use your own PSDK codebase to manage versioning more precisely, you can create a submodule at the root of your project folder.

If PSDK detects a `pokemonsdk` folder at the root of your project, it will load from that directory instead.

## Specifications

Contrary to `PSP` or `Essentials`, `PSDK` doesn't use the RGSS. We wrote a graphic engine called `LiteRGSS` using `SFML`, which allows a better mastering of the Graphic part of PSDK like adding Shaders, turning some graphic process to C++ side etc.
